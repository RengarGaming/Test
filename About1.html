<p>Until she was 13 years old, Atkins and her family lived in a middle-class home in the Cambrian Park area of San Jose, California.</p>
<p>She was described by those who knew her as a quiet, self-conscious girl who belonged to her school's glee club and the local church choir.</p>
<p>Two weeks before her mother was hospitalized for the final time, Susan arranged for members of the church choir to sing Christmas carols under her bedroom window.</p>
<p>After Jeanette Atkins' death, relatives were asked to help look after Susan and her two brothers.</p>
<p>Edward Atkins eventually moved to Los Banos, California, with Susan and her younger brother Steven.</p>
<p>When he found work on the San Luis Dam construction project, Edward left the two children behind to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>Susan took a job during her junior year in school to support herself and Steven.</p>
