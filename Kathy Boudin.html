<h1>Early Life</h1>
<p>Kathy Boudin was born on May 19, 1943, into a family with a long left-wing history, and she was raised in Greenwich Village, New York.</p>
<p>Her family was Jewish. Her great-uncle was Louis B. Boudin, a Marxist theorist.</p>
<p>Her father, attorney Leonard Boudin, had represented such controversial clients as Judith Coplon, the Cuban government, and Paul Robeson.</p>
<p>A National Lawyers Guild attorney, Leonard Boudin was the law partner of Victor Rabinowitz, himself counsel to numerous left-wing organizations.</p>
<p>Kathy Boudin attended Bryn Mawr College and is a member of the class of 1965.</p>
<h1>Weather Underground</h1>
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, Boudin became heavily involved with the Weather Underground.</p>
<p>The Weather Underground bombed The Pentagon, the United States Capitol, the New York Police Benevolent Association, the New York Board of Corrections, as well as the offices of multinational companies.</p>
<p>Boudin, along with Cathy Wilkerson, was a survivor of the 1970 Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, which occurred when a nail bomb that WU members were building and intending to detonate at a soldiers' dance at Fort Dix, New Jersey exploded prematurely, killing three of their members.</p>
<p>Boudin was 27 at the time. Both women were awaiting trial, out on bond for their alleged actions in Days of Rage in Chicago several months earlier.</p>
<p>She fled underground with other members of the WU during the 1970s, during which time she fell in love with fellow member David Gilbert and gave birth to their son Chesa in 1980.</p>

<h1>1981 Brink's Robbery</h1>
<p>In 1981, Boudin and several former members of the Weather Underground and the Black Liberation Army robbed a Brink's armored car at the Nanuet Mall, in Nanuet, New York.</p>
<p>After Boudin dropped her infant son off at a babysitter's, she took the wheel of the getaway vehicle, a U-Haul truck.</p>
<p>She waited in a nearby parking lot as her heavily armed accomplices took another vehicle to a local mall where the Brink's truck was making a pick-up.</p>
<p>They confronted the guards and gunfire immediately broke out, severely wounding guard Joseph Trombino and killing his partner, Peter Paige.</p>
<p>The four then took $1.6 million in cash and rejoined Boudin.</p>
<br></br>
<p>An alert college student called the police after spotting the gang abandoning their vehicle and entering the U-Haul.</p>
<p>Two policeman spotted and pulled over the U-Haul, but they were expecting black males, and could only see Boudin – a white female – in the driver's seat.</p>
<p>She got out of the cab, and raised her hands. Another police car with two officers quickly arrived on the scene.</p>
<br></br>
<p>The police officers who caught them testified that Boudin, feigning innocence, pleaded with them to put down their guns and got them to drop their guard; Boudin said she remained silent, that the officers relaxed spontaneously.</p>
<br></br>
<p>After the police lowered their guns, six men armed with automatic weapons emerged from the back of the truck, and began firing upon the four police officers, one of whom, Waverly Brown, was killed instantly.</p>
<p>Officer Edward O'Grady lived long enough to empty his revolver, but as he reloaded, he was shot several times with an M16 rifle.</p>
<p>Ninety minutes later, he died in the hospital. The other two officers escaped with minor injuries.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Boudin and Gilbert allegedly acted as decoys as well as getaway drivers.</p>
<br></br>
<p>The occupants of the U-Haul scattered, some climbing into another getaway car, others carjacking a nearby motorist while Boudin attempted to flee on foot. </p>
<p>An off-duty corrections officer, Michael J. Koch, apprehended her shortly after the shootout. When she was arrested, Boudin gave her name as Barbara Edson.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Gilbert, Samuel Brown, and Judith Alice Clark crashed their car while making a sharp turn, and were arrested by police.</p>
<p>Three Black Liberation Army members also failed to escape that day.</p>
<p>Two days later, Samuel Smith and Nathaniel Burns were spotted in a car in New York.</p>
<p>After a gunfight with police that left Smith dead, Burns was captured. Three more participants were arrested several months later.</p>
<br></br>
<p>The majority of the defendants received three consecutive sentences of 25-years-to-life, making them eligible for parole in the year 2058.</p>
<p>Boudin hired Leonard Weinglass to defend her. Weinglass, a law partner of Boudin's father, arranged for a plea bargain and Boudin pleaded guilty to one count of felony murder and robbery, in exchange for one 20-years-to-life sentence.</p>
<p>By comparison, David Gilbert received 70-years-to-life and as of 2015, is still incarcerated.</p>
<p>After the couple began their prison sentences, WU co-founder William Ayers and his wife Bernardine Dohrn adopted Chesa Boudin and raised him as their own son.</p>
<br></br>
<p>At the time of the robbery Women's eNews founder Rita Henley Jensen had been Boudin's roommate.</p>
<p>After the robbery Jensen was fired by a newspaper she had been employed by; the paper claimed that she had let lies about what she knew of Boudin's identity be published in it,</p>
<p>while Jensen claimed she had actually been fired for not writing a first-person story about being Boudin's roommate, and that accounts in the news had misconstrued her claims about her knowledge of Boudin's identity.</p>
<p>Jensen's daughter later stated that she (Jensen) had been blacklisted. However, Jensen was later able to return to work as a journalist.</p>
