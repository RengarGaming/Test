<h1>History</h1>
<p>Velma Barfield was born in rural South Carolina, but was raised near Fayetteville, North Carolina. Barfield's father reportedly was physically abusive and her mother, Lillian Bullard, did not intervene.</p>
<p>She escaped by marrying Thomas Burke in 1949. The couple had two children and were reportedly happy until Barfield had a hysterectomy and developed back pain.</p>
<p>These events led to a behavioral change in Barfield and an eventual drug addiction.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Burke began to drink and Barfield's complaints turned into bitter arguments.</p>
<p>On April 4, 1969, after Burke had passed out, Barfield and the children left the house, and when they returned they found the structure burned and Burke dead.</p>
<p>A few months later, her own home burned down but was insured. In 1970, Barfield married a widower, Jennings Barfield. Less than a year after their marriage, Jennings died on March 22, 1971 from heart complications.</p>
<br></br>
<p>In 1974, Lillian Bullard, Barfield's mother, showed symptoms of intense diarrhea, vomiting and nausea, only to fully recover a few days later.</p>
<p>During the Christmas season of the same year, Bullard experienced the same earlier illness, but died in the hospital a few hours after being admitted on December 30, 1974.</p>
<br></br>
<p>In 1976, Velma Barfield began caring for the elderly, working for Montgomery and Dollie Edwards.</p>
<p>Montgomery fell ill and died on January 29, 1977. A little over a month after the death of her husband, Dollie experienced identical symptoms to that of Bullard and died on March 1. </p>
<p>Barfield later confessed to the latter death.[1] The following year, Barfield took another caretaker job, this time for 76-year-old Record Lee, who had broken her leg.</p>
<p>On June 4, 1977, Lee's husband, John Henry, began experiencing racking pains in his stomach and chest along with vomiting and diarrhea. He died soon afterward and Barfield later confessed to his murder.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Another victim was Rowland Stuart Taylor, Barfield's boyfriend and a relative of Dollie Edwards.</p>
<p>Fearing he had discovered she had been forging checks on his account, Barfield mixed an arsenic-based rat poison into his beer and tea.</p>
<p>He died on February 3, 1978, while she was trying to "nurse" him back to health; an autopsy found arsenic in Taylor's system.</p>
<p>After her arrest, the body of Jennings was exhumed and found to have traces of arsenic, a murder that Barfield denied having committed.</p>
<p>Although she subsequently confessed to the murders of Bullard, Dollie, and John Henry Lee, she was tried and convicted only for the murder of Taylor.</p>
<p>Singer-songwriter Jonathan Byrd is the grandson of Jennings and his first wife. His song "Velma" from his Wildflowers album gives a personal account of the murders and investigation.</p>

<div id="Info" class="tabcontent">
<p>She was an American serial killer who was convicted of one murder, but who eventually confessed to six murders in total.</p>
<p>Barfield was imprisoned at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, in an area for escape-prone prisoners and mentally ill prisoners, as there was no designated area for women under death sentences at the time and she was the state's only female death row inmate.</p>
<p>A death row unit for female inmates in North Carolina was subsequently established at the North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women.</p>
<br></br>
<p>During her stay on death row, Barfield became a devout born again Christian.</p>
<p>Her last few years were spent ministering to prisoners, for which she received praise from Billy Graham.</p>
<p>Barfield's involvement in Christian ministry was extensive to the point that an effort was made to obtain a commutation to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>A second basis for the appeal was the testimony of Dorothy Otnow Lewis, Professor of Psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine and an authority on violent behavior, who claimed that Barfield suffered from dissociative identity disorder.</p>
<p>Lewis testified that she had spoken to Barfield's other personality, "Billy", who told her that Velma had been a victim of sexual abuse, and that he, Billy, had killed her abusers.</p>
<p>The judge was unconvinced. "One of them did it," Lewis quoted him as saying. "I don't care which one."</p>
<br></br>
<p>After Barfield's appeal was denied in federal court, she instructed her attorneys to abandon a further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Barfield was executed on November 2, 1984 at Central Prison. She released a statement before the execution: "I know that everybody has gone through a lot of pain, all the families connected, and I am sorry, and I want to thank everybody who have been supporting me all these six years."</p>
<p>Barfield chose as her last meal 1 bag of Cheetos and two 8-ounce glass bottles of Coca-Cola.</p>
<p> Barfield was buried in a small, rural North Carolina cemetery near her first husband, Thomas Burke.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Barfield's execution raised some political controversies when Governor Jim Hunt, who was challenging incumbent Jesse Helms for his U.S. Senate seat, rejected Barfield's request for clemency. Hunt lost the election.</p>
