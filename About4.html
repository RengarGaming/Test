<h1>Early Life</h1>
<p>Kathy Boudin was born on May 19, 1943, into a family with a long left-wing history, and she was raised in Greenwich Village, New York.</p>
<p>Her family was Jewish. Her great-uncle was Louis B. Boudin, a Marxist theorist.</p>
<p>Her father, attorney Leonard Boudin, had represented such controversial clients as Judith Coplon, the Cuban government, and Paul Robeson.</p>
<p>A National Lawyers Guild attorney, Leonard Boudin was the law partner of Victor Rabinowitz, himself counsel to numerous left-wing organizations.</p>
<p>Kathy Boudin attended Bryn Mawr College and is a member of the class of 1965.</p>
<h1>Weather Underground</h1>
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, Boudin became heavily involved with the Weather Underground.</p>
<p>The Weather Underground bombed The Pentagon, the United States Capitol, the New York Police Benevolent Association, the New York Board of Corrections, as well as the offices of multinational companies.</p>
<p>Boudin, along with Cathy Wilkerson, was a survivor of the 1970 Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, which occurred when a nail bomb that WU members were building and intending to detonate at a soldiers' dance at Fort Dix, New Jersey exploded prematurely, killing three of their members.</p>
<p>Boudin was 27 at the time. Both women were awaiting trial, out on bond for their alleged actions in Days of Rage in Chicago several months earlier.</p>
<p>She fled underground with other members of the WU during the 1970s, during which time she fell in love with fellow member David Gilbert and gave birth to their son Chesa in 1980.</p>
