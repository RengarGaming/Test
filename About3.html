<p>Celeste Beard Johnson born February 13, 1963, more commonly known as Celeste Beard, is a convicted American murderer who is serving a life sentence at the Murray Unit in Gatesville, Texas for the 1999 murder of her millionaire husband, Steven Beard. She is Texas Department of Criminal Justice offender #01157250.</p>
<p>Celeste Johnson's biological parents are unknown.</p>
<p>She claimed that her adoptive parents, Edwin and Nancy Johnson, physically abused her as a child and she made a suicidal gesture during puberty.</p>
<p>At age 17 she became pregnant and gave birth to twins, Jennifer and Kristina, with first husband Craig Bratcher.</p>
<p>After their divorce, Celeste Johnson lost custody of her daughters.</p>
<p>She married twice more before meeting Steven Beard while she was a waitress at the Austin Country Club.</p>
<p>Beard, a retired Fox Broadcasting Company executive and self-made multi-millionaire more than twice her age, was a widower whose wife had died of cancer.</p>
<p>Johnson moved in with him after he convinced her that he would help her regain custody of her daughters.</p>
<p>After winning the case, they began dating in secret (with Johnson pretending to be Beard's housekeeper) until Beard's daughter discovered them in a hotel room during the 1993 Super Bowl.</p>
<p>They were married on February 18, 1995, with Beard's family and friends suspicious that Johnson had married him for his money.</p>
