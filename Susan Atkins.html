<div id="About" class="tabcontent" style="background-color: black;">
<p>Susan Denise Atkins born on May 7, 1948 died in September 24, 2009. She lived in San Gabriel, California, the second of three children, Susan Atkins grew up in northern California. </p>
<p>According to her, her parents, Jeanette and Edward John Atkins, were alcoholics.</p>
<p>Her mother died of cancer in 1963. Over the next three years, Susan's life was disrupted by the gradual breakup of her family, frequent relocations, and her leaving home to live independently.</p>
<p>Until she was 13 years old, Atkins and her family lived in a middle-class home in the Cambrian Park area of San Jose, California.</p>
<p>She was described by those who knew her as a quiet, self-conscious girl who belonged to her school's glee club and the local church choir.</p>
<p>Two weeks before her mother was hospitalized for the final time, Susan arranged for members of the church choir to sing Christmas carols under her bedroom window.</p>
<p>After Jeanette Atkins' death, relatives were asked to help look after Susan and her two brothers.</p>
<p>Edward Atkins eventually moved to Los Banos, California, with Susan and her younger brother Steven.</p>
<p>When he found work on the San Luis Dam construction project, Edward left the two children behind to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>Susan took a job during her junior year in school to support herself and Steven.</p>
<p>Atkins had been an average student in Leigh High School in San Jose, but her grades deteriorated when she entered Los Banos High School.</p>
<p>During this time, she lived with various relatives.</p>
<br></br>
<p>In 1967, Atkins met Manson when he played guitar at the house where she was living with several friends.</p>
<p>When the house was raided several weeks later by the police and Atkins was left homeless, Manson invited her to join his group, who were embarking on a summer road trip in a converted school bus painted completely black.</p>
<p>She was nicknamed "Sadie Mae Glutz" by Manson and a man who was creating a fake ID for her at the time.</p>
<p>Atkins later claimed to have believed Manson was Jesus.</p>
<p>The growing "Manson Family" settled at the Spahn Ranch in the San Fernando Valley in southern California, where, on October 7, 1968, Atkins bore a son by Bruce White, whom Manson called Zezozose Zadfrack Glutz.</p>
<p>Atkins' parental rights were terminated once she was convicted of the murders and no one in her family would assume responsibility for the child.</p>
<p>Her son was adopted and renamed from the time of her incarceration in 1969.She had no further contact with him.</p>
<p>She was 61 years old when she died, reason for dying was brain cancer.</p>

<p>She was convicted American murderer who was a member of Charles Manson's "Family".<p>
<p>Manson's followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in California, over a period of five weeks in the summer of 1969.</p>
<p>Atkins was convicted for her participation in eight of these killings, including the most notorious, the Tate murders. </p>
<p>She was sentenced to death, which was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment.
<p> Atkins was incarcerated from October 1, 1969, until her death, a period exactly one week short of 40 years.</p>
<p>At the time of her death, Atkins was California's longest-serving female inmate.<p>
<h1>Murder of Gary Hinman</h1>
<p>During the summer of 1969, Manson and his commune at Spahn's Ranch were attracting the attention of the police, who suspected them of auto thefts and were suspicious of the high number of underage runaways.</p>
<p>In an attempt to raise money to move away to the desert, Manson encouraged drug dealing.</p>
<p>Purportedly, a botched drug scam by Family member Charles "Tex" Watson led Manson to confront and shoot a man by the name of Bernard "Lotsapapa" Crowe</p>
<p>Manson believed he had killed Crowe, and he further believed Crowe was a Black Panther. Neither was true. Nonetheless, Manson feared retaliation from the Black Panthers and pressured his followers for more money</p>
<p>During this time someone suggested that an old friend, Gary Hinman, had just inherited a large sum of money.</p>
<p>Manson hoped Hinman could be persuaded to join the commune and contribute his purported new inheritance.</p>
<p>Manson sent Atkins, Bobby Beausoleil, and Mary Brunner to Hinman's home on July 25, 1969.</p>
<p>When she pleaded guilty to murder, Atkins claimed she didn't know a crime was going to take place, although she wrote in her 1977. book that she went to Hinman's home to get money and knew that it was possible they were going to kill him.</p>
<p>When Hinman insisted he had not inherited any money, Beausoleil beat him severely.</p>
<p>When this didn't change Hinman's story, Manson showed up in person, and swung at his head with a sword, slicing his face and severely cutting his ear.</p>
<p>Manson directed Atkins and Brunner to stay behind and tend to Hinman's wounds.</p>
<p>Two days later, and after a phone call from Manson, Beausoleil had Hinman sign over the registrations to his cars and then fatally stabbed him twice.</p>
<p>Beausoleil left a bloody hand print on the wall along with vague revolutionary words reportedly placed there in hopes of implicating the Black Panthers.</p>
<p>Beausoleil was arrested on August 7, 1969, when he was found asleep in one of Hinman's vehicles.</p>
<p>He was still wearing the bloodstained clothing he wore during the crime.</p>
<p>The murder weapon was hidden in the tire well of the car's trunk.</p>
<h1 class="Info5">Sharon Tate and LaBianca murders<h1>
<p class="Info6">On the evening of August 9, 1969, Manson gathered Atkins, Linda Kasabian, and Patricia Krenwinkel in front of Spahn's Ranch and told them to go with Charles "Tex" Watson and do as they were told.</p>
<p class="Info6">In Atkins' grand jury testimony, she stated that while in the car, Watson told the group they were going to a home to get money from the people who lived there and to kill them.</p>
<p class="Info6">Six people (includes Sharon Tate's baby) were murdered at the Benedict Canyon home where Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate lived: Tate (who was eight months pregnant), Steven Parent, Jay Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski, and Abigail Folger.</p>
<p class="Info6">Polanski, Tate's husband, was in Europe finishing work on a film project. Forensic evidence indicated that the murders were brutal. Just prior to leaving the residence, Atkins wrote "PIG" on the front door in Sharon Tate's blood.</p>
<p class="Info6">The following night, August 10, 1969, Manson commented that the murders at the Tate residence had been too messy and announced he'd have to take his followers out and "show them how it's done".</p>
<p class="Info6">Manson called Atkins, Krenwinkel, Watson, Linda Kasabian, Leslie Van Houten, and Steve "Clem" Grogan, and they left Spahn's Ranch.</p>
<p class="Info6">Driving most of the night, he eventually found the home of grocery store owner Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary in Los Feliz, a section of northeastern Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="Info6">Manson and Watson entered the home and tied the couple up at gunpoint, winning their compliance by convincing them they were only going to be robbed.</p>
<p class="Info6">He then went back to the car and sent Krenwinkel and Van Houten inside to do as Tex said, once again directing them to leave writings in blood, and to hitchhike back to Spahn's Ranch.</p>
