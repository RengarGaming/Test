<div id="About" class="tabcontent" style="background-color: black;">
<p>Name: Charles Manson.</p>
<p>Born: November 12, 1934.</p>
<p>Occupation: Singer-songwriter, Criminal.</p>
<p>Raised: Cincinnati, Ohio</p>
<p>Family: Colonel W. H., Scott Sr., Kathleen Maddox, William Manson</p>
<h1 STYLE="Background-color: grey;">Early Life</h1>
<p>Charles Manson Charles Manson was born to unmarried 16-year-old Kathleen Manson-Bower-Cavender, nee Maddox (born on 1918. died 1973.), in the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center in Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
<p>He was first named "no name Maddox". Within weeks, he was called Charles Milles Maddox.</p>
<p>Manson's biological father appears to have been Colonel Walker Henderson Scott Sr. (born on 1910. died in 1954.) against whom Kathleen Maddox filed a paternity suit that resulted in an agreed judgment in 1937.</p>
<p>Manson may never have known his biological father. Scott worked intermittently in local mills, and also had a local reputation as a con artist.</p>
<p>He allowed Maddox to believe he was an army colonel, although "Colonel" was merely his given name.</p>
<p>When Maddox told Scott she was pregnant, he told her he had been called away on army business; after several months she realized he had no intention of returning.</p>
<br></br>
<p>In August 1934, before Manson's birth, Maddox married William Eugene Manson (born on 1909. died in 1961.), whose occupation was listed on Charles's birth certificate as a "laborer" at a dry cleaning business.</p>
<p>Maddox went on drinking sprees for days at a time with her brother Luther, leaving Charles with a variety of babysitters.</p>
<p>They were divorced on April 30, 1937, when a court accepted Manson's charge of "gross neglect of duty".</p>
<br></br>
<p>On August 1, 1939, Maddox and Luther's girlfriend Julia Vickers spent the evening drinking with Frank Martin, a new acquaintance who appeared to be wealthy.</p>
<p>Maddox and Vickers decided to rob him, and Maddox phoned her brother to help. They were incompetent thieves, and were found and arrested within hours.</p>
<p>At the trial seven weeks later, Luther was sentenced to ten years in prison, and Kathleen was sentenced to five years.</p>
<p>Manson was placed in the home of an aunt and uncle in McMechen, West Virginia. His mother was paroled in 1942. Manson later characterized the first weeks after she returned from prison as the happiest time in his life.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Manson's family moved to Charleston, West Virginia, where Manson continually played truant and his mother spent her evenings drinking.</p>
<p>She was arrested for grand larceny, but not convicted. After moving to Indianapolis, Maddox started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings where she met an alcoholic named Lewis (no first name), whom she married in August 1943.</p>
<p>As well as constantly playing truant, Manson began stealing from stores and his home. In 1947, Maddox looked for a temporary foster home for Manson, but she was unable to find a suitable one. </p>
<p>She decided to send him to the Gibault School for Boys in Terre Haute, Indiana, a school for male delinquents run by Catholic priests. </p>
<p>Manson soon fled home to his mother, but she took him back to the school. He spent Christmas 1947 in McMechen, at his aunt and uncle's house, where he was caught stealing a gun.</p>

<div id="Info" class="tabcontent">
<p>Charles Milles Manson (né Maddox, November 12, 1934 – November 19, 2017) was an American criminal and cult leader.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, he formed what became known as the Manson Family, a quasi-commune in California. Manson's followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969.</p>
<p>In 1971, he was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, all of which members of the group carried out at his instruction.</p>
<p>Manson was also convicted of first-degree murder for two other deaths.</p>
<h1 STYLE="Background-color: grey;">First offenses</h1>
<p>Manson returned to Gibault but ran away to Indianapolis ten months later. Instead of returning to his mother, he rented a room and supported himself by burglarizing stores at night.</p>
<p>He was eventually caught, and a sympathetic judge sent him to Boys Town, a juvenile facility in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
<p>After four days, he and a student named Blackie Nielson stole a car and somehow obtained a gun.</p>
<p>They used it to rob a grocery store and a casino, as they made their way to the home of Nielson's uncle in Peoria, Illinois.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Neilson's uncle was a professional thief, and when the boys arrived he apparently took them on as apprentices.</p>
<p>Manson was arrested two weeks later during a nighttime raid on a Peoria store. In the investigation that followed, he was linked to his two earlier armed robberies.	</p>
<p>He was sent to the Indiana Boys School, a strict reform school.</p>
<p>He later claimed that other students raped him with the encouragement of a staff member. Manson developed a self-defense technique he later called the "insane game". </p>
<p>When he was physically unable to defend himself he would screech, grimace and wave his arms to convince aggressors that he was insane.</p>
<p>After a number of failed attempts, he escaped with two other boys in February 1951.</p>
<br></br>
<p>The three escapees were attempting to drive to California in stolen cars when they were arrested in Utah.</p>
<p>They had robbed several filling stations along the way. Driving a stolen car across state lines is a federal crime that violates the Dyer Act.</p>
<p>Manson was sent to Washington, D.C.'s National Training School for Boys.</p>
<p>On arrival he was given aptitude tests. He was illiterate, and his IQ was 109 (the national average was 100). His case worker deemed him aggressively antisocial.</p>
