<h1>1981 Brink's Robbery</h1>
<p>In 1981, Boudin and several former members of the Weather Underground and the Black Liberation Army robbed a Brink's armored car at the Nanuet Mall, in Nanuet, New York.</p>
<p>After Boudin dropped her infant son off at a babysitter's, she took the wheel of the getaway vehicle, a U-Haul truck.</p>
<p>She waited in a nearby parking lot as her heavily armed accomplices took another vehicle to a local mall where the Brink's truck was making a pick-up.</p>
<p>They confronted the guards and gunfire immediately broke out, severely wounding guard Joseph Trombino and killing his partner, Peter Paige.</p>
<p>The four then took $1.6 million in cash and rejoined Boudin.</p>
<br></br>
<p>An alert college student called the police after spotting the gang abandoning their vehicle and entering the U-Haul.</p>
<p>Two policeman spotted and pulled over the U-Haul, but they were expecting black males, and could only see Boudin – a white female – in the driver's seat.</p>
<p>She got out of the cab, and raised her hands. Another police car with two officers quickly arrived on the scene.</p>
<br></br>
<p>The police officers who caught them testified that Boudin, feigning innocence, pleaded with them to put down their guns and got them to drop their guard; Boudin said she remained silent, that the officers relaxed spontaneously.</p>
<br></br>
<p>After the police lowered their guns, six men armed with automatic weapons emerged from the back of the truck, and began firing upon the four police officers, one of whom, Waverly Brown, was killed instantly.</p>
<p>Officer Edward O'Grady lived long enough to empty his revolver, but as he reloaded, he was shot several times with an M16 rifle.</p>
<p>Ninety minutes later, he died in the hospital. The other two officers escaped with minor injuries.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Boudin and Gilbert allegedly acted as decoys as well as getaway drivers.</p>
<br></br>
<p>The occupants of the U-Haul scattered, some climbing into another getaway car, others carjacking a nearby motorist while Boudin attempted to flee on foot. </p>
<p>An off-duty corrections officer, Michael J. Koch, apprehended her shortly after the shootout. When she was arrested, Boudin gave her name as Barbara Edson.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Gilbert, Samuel Brown, and Judith Alice Clark crashed their car while making a sharp turn, and were arrested by police.</p>
<p>Three Black Liberation Army members also failed to escape that day.</p>
<p>Two days later, Samuel Smith and Nathaniel Burns were spotted in a car in New York.</p>
<p>After a gunfight with police that left Smith dead, Burns was captured. Three more participants were arrested several months later.</p>
<br></br>
<p>The majority of the defendants received three consecutive sentences of 25-years-to-life, making them eligible for parole in the year 2058.</p>
<p>Boudin hired Leonard Weinglass to defend her. Weinglass, a law partner of Boudin's father, arranged for a plea bargain and Boudin pleaded guilty to one count of felony murder and robbery, in exchange for one 20-years-to-life sentence.</p>
<p>By comparison, David Gilbert received 70-years-to-life and as of 2015, is still incarcerated.</p>
<p>After the couple began their prison sentences, WU co-founder William Ayers and his wife Bernardine Dohrn adopted Chesa Boudin and raised him as their own son.</p>
<br></br>
<p>At the time of the robbery Women's eNews founder Rita Henley Jensen had been Boudin's roommate.</p>
<p>After the robbery Jensen was fired by a newspaper she had been employed by; the paper claimed that she had let lies about what she knew of Boudin's identity be published in it,</p>
<p>while Jensen claimed she had actually been fired for not writing a first-person story about being Boudin's roommate, and that accounts in the news had misconstrued her claims about her knowledge of Boudin's identity.</p>
<p>Jensen's daughter later stated that she (Jensen) had been blacklisted. However, Jensen was later able to return to work as a journalist.</p>
