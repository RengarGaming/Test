<p>She was an American serial killer who was convicted of one murder, but who eventually confessed to six murders in total.</p>
<p>Barfield was imprisoned at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, in an area for escape-prone prisoners and mentally ill prisoners, as there was no designated area for women under death sentences at the time and she was the state's only female death row inmate.</p>
<p>A death row unit for female inmates in North Carolina was subsequently established at the North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women.</p>
<br></br>
<p>During her stay on death row, Barfield became a devout born again Christian.</p>
<p>Her last few years were spent ministering to prisoners, for which she received praise from Billy Graham.</p>
<p>Barfield's involvement in Christian ministry was extensive to the point that an effort was made to obtain a commutation to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>A second basis for the appeal was the testimony of Dorothy Otnow Lewis, Professor of Psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine and an authority on violent behavior, who claimed that Barfield suffered from dissociative identity disorder.</p>
<p>Lewis testified that she had spoken to Barfield's other personality, "Billy", who told her that Velma had been a victim of sexual abuse, and that he, Billy, had killed her abusers.</p>
<p>The judge was unconvinced. "One of them did it," Lewis quoted him as saying. "I don't care which one."</p>
<br></br>
<p>After Barfield's appeal was denied in federal court, she instructed her attorneys to abandon a further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Barfield was executed on November 2, 1984 at Central Prison. She released a statement before the execution: "I know that everybody has gone through a lot of pain, all the families connected, and I am sorry, and I want to thank everybody who have been supporting me all these six years."</p>
<p>Barfield chose as her last meal 1 bag of Cheetos and two 8-ounce glass bottles of Coca-Cola.</p>
<p> Barfield was buried in a small, rural North Carolina cemetery near her first husband, Thomas Burke.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Barfield's execution raised some political controversies when Governor Jim Hunt, who was challenging incumbent Jesse Helms for his U.S. Senate seat, rejected Barfield's request for clemency. Hunt lost the election.</p>
